                    <div class="abdullah-info-body">
                        <p>Abdullah Ahmad is a graduate of Government College Peshawar, Pakistan, and is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences. From a young age, Abdullah has been passionate about computing and coding, consistently seeking to bring value to others' lives through his skills and dedication to technology. </p>

                        <p>Before embarking on his higher education, Abdullah delved deeply into various programming languages, including PHP, JavaScript, and Python, along with their associated libraries and frameworks, as well as HTML and CSS. Recognizing the gap in his computing skills due to his engineering academic background, he took the initiative to learn through platforms like freeCodeCamp, earning certifications and working on diverse projects. This hands-on experience enabled him to build websites for friends, addressing real-time and real-world problems while working under tight deadlines as a freelancer.</p>

                        <p>Throughout his academic journey, Abdullah has excelled in STEM subjects, demonstrating a high level of proficiency and commitment to his work. His dedication and expertise have driven him to co-found "WebWorksPro," a web services agency with a mission to provide top-tier services and hosting solutions to elevate business websites into the modern technological landscape.</p>

                        <p>Abdullah has also developed a YouTube clone and several blog sites, showcasing his programming prowess. Additionally, he has successfully created a website for a school using PHP, JavaScript, SQL & MySQL for database and database management, HTML, and CSS, demonstrating his ability to apply his technical skills to diverse projects and real-world applications.</p>

                    <div class="muhammad-info-body">
                        <p>Muhammad Ahsan is also a graduate of Government College Peshawar and a dedicated student of Software Engineering at the Institute of Management Sciences, Peshawar. His academic journey began with a strong focus on physics and mathematics during high school and college. However, recognizing the challenges of pursuing a career in physics, he made a strategic switch to computer science, specifically software engineering. Before his formal classes began, Muhammad proactively enrolled in an online course to learn C++ and core programming concepts, which laid a strong foundation for his future studies.</p>

                        <p>Once his classes commenced, Muhammad's prior knowledge of C++ made the coursework more manageable. His first semester included an introduction to frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which further fueled his passion for programming. As he progressed to his second semester, he delved into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java, successfully completing a data visualization project that converted CSV file data into graphical representations. This hands-on project experience solidified his understanding of practical software development.</p>

                        <p>During a summer break, instead of taking time off, Muhammad chose to enhance his skills by learning JavaScript. This period of self-improvement coincided with an opportunity presented by his college friend, Abdullah Ahmad. Abdullah proposed the idea of collaborating on a web services agency, which they had named "WebWorksPro." Enthusiastic about the prospect, Muhammad joined as a co-founder, and they began working together to establish the agency.</p>

                        <p>Since its inception, Muhammad has been an integral part of WebWorksPro, contributing to its mission of providing top-quality web services to clients. His journey with Abdullah has not only strengthened their professional bond but also allowed him to apply and expand his technical skills in a real-world setting. As a prominent shareholder and co-founder of WebWorksPro, Muhammad remains committed to delivering excellence and innovation in web solutions, reflecting his deep-seated passion for software engineering.</p>
